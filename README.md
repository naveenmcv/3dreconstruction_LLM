I'd recommend checking up Houdini GSOPs plugin!

As far as I know, Kiri Engine is the only one that can do 3DGS to Mesh at the moment. The results look really good, but unfortunately, it is limited by filesize (I think 2GB is the limit), so the textures do come out muddy sometimes.

Could you get to a mesh with a dense point cloud from something like OpenMVS? Iâ€™m a newbie and self teaching. So this is just my barely know anything idea.
